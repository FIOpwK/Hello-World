Updated "Hello World!" program. 

Logic: Beginners are capable of understanding two lines of code. We should expand the introduction to include:
- variables
- assignment statements
- usage of Class
- usage of Method
- invoking of Method
- understanding the execution flow



Example:

Instead of doing:
    - `Console.WriteLine("Hello World");`

perhaps we can expand the understanding with a variable and an assignement statement.

- `var text = "Hello World!";`
- `Console.WriteLine(text);`

These two lines of code help beginners understand a bit more of how to write programs, rather than just using a feature of a language for example sake.

There is really no body or group to standardize this approach, but we should adapt this as a way of showing that "Hello World!" has been updated since its existance. 

In theory it would update from HelloWorld-0.1 to HelloWorld-1.1 or however the community decides to do versioning of the common program. Because, after all the "Hello World!" program *is* considered a program. (1 line or 2)


Think of all the posibilities of this new way of writing the program. One beneficial example I see is the exploration and usage of "String methods". Beginners can begine to use core functionality of the language earlier in their learning. 

Another benefit, not as obvious is the conversation surrounding the passing in of a parameter rather than using a String literal inside the WriteLine() method of the Console class. Sure, as a beginner you may or may not know those terms, but at least you are introduced to the shape of these terms if nothing else.

So, join me in welcoming in the new Hello World program. May it live on as the new, upgraded defacto.
